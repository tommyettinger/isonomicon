# isonomicon
A collection of isometric pixel art, and the software that generates it.

This project uses voxel models in MagicaVoxel's format and renders them to isometric pixel art, much like
[another project of mine](https://github.com/tommyettinger/IsoVoxel). The aim here is to build up a resource set of lots of pixel
art rendered from that voxel art, all sharing a similar style.

## Credits
This project is based closely off of [WarpWriter](https://github.com/tommyettinger/WarpWriter), a joint effort of
[Tommy Ettinger](https://github.com/tommyettinger) and [Ben McLean](https://github.com/BenMcLean). Isonomicon has a different set
of goals; it is still meant to use voxel rendering to make pixel art, but it doesn't try to do so at runtime.
